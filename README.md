##The Problem
>Accidents: 4,64,674 collisions caused 1,48,707 deaths in India in 2016 according to the NCRB.
>Negligence: Often, the public don’t have the means or facility to raise complaints or awareness about bad roads thus leading to neglect of the same.
>The Truth: Police reports often hold the drivers responsible, despite the fact that unsafe roads aren’t fixed, even several months after being recognised as accident prone.

##The Solution 
>We aim to provide live data on the conditions of roads, locations of potholes, and more, thus making it easier for the municipality to keep roads well maintained and safe.
